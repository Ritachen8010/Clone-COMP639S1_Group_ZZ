            (....)
        - `/dashboard_sidebar_template`
            - `xxx.html`
            (....)
        - (for more please refer to our templates folder, additional directories and templates for other views)

    - `/static`: This directory contains static files such as CSS stylesheets and images.
        - `/homepage`

      - `/css`: This directory contains CSS files for styling the web pages.
  - `run.py`: The entry point to run the Flask application.

2. The web through 'POST' and 'GET' fetches and displays the details to send the request to update the database. 
3. Use different HTML to redirect to different pages. 
4. When login the web can lead users to different types of dashboards by role determined, as the web only allows members to register. instructors and managers are only can be added by the system.

## Getting Started
- Please refer to `requirements.txt` for the necessary dependencies to install.
- Our web application is developed using technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, Python, Bootstrap, MySQL, etc.

## Design Decision
- The main objectives of this web application are:
    1. To be user-friendly.
    2. To align with a swimming theme, making it visually appealing.
    3. To provide prompt feedback for user operations.
- Therefore, we chose blue as the main color scheme, using different shades of blue to enhance the visual design. We used Bootstrap for navigation components and grid systems, and CSS for adjusting padding, spacing, and color.

## Database Design
- The database consists of 14 tables: User, Manager, Instructor, Member, Memberships, Memberships_refund, News, Class_name, Class_schedule, Lesson_name, Lesson_schedule, Bookings, Payment, and Attendance.

To handle our main functions:
- The User table (represented in blue) handles the login and register functions.
- The Bookings table (represented in pink) handles the booking functions.
- The Payment table (represented in green) handles the record payment function.
